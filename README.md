# git-quick

Use `git-quick` to navigate between git repositories on your machine and issue 
basic commands like `git status` or  `git pull`.

This is a Rust program that you can install with `cargo install git-quick`.
(To obtain `cargo` and Rust, see https://rustup.rs.) Once installed, you gain
an extra git subcommand that you can run from anywhere to navigate between
all your git repos: `git quick`.
